I'm a first year PhD student at the University of California, Riverside.

🔬 My research interests are in abrupt climate transitions across the deep geological time!

📚 I'm currently working towards my doctoral candidacy.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of climate sciences and Southeast Asian history.
