I'm a first year PhD student at the University of California, Riverside.

🔬 My research interests are in abrupt climate transitions across the deep geological time!

🎓 I'm currently working towards my doctoral candidacy.

🌏  I am also interested in other subjects in the climate sciences and Southeast Asian history.
